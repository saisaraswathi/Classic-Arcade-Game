# CLASSIC ARCADE GAME CLONE
 Welcome to my 2D game. The project focused on _Object Oriented JavaScript_, you can find initial repository [here] (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
 Rules are simple please see below. Good Luck!

## How to Start the Game :
  * Ensure that all the html, css, js files are stored locally in the same area and also the index.html file.
  * Double-click the index.html file so that it opens in your browser.
  * Select the player image in the drop down list.

## How to Play the Game :
  * Use the arrow keys(Up, down, left, right) for the movement of the player through the screen board.
  * Your Goal is to navigate the player to try and get to the River.
  * But avoid the ** Enemy bugs** because if the player collides with them, again the game starts.
  * When the player reaches the water the Score gets increased by **10 points**.
